                  CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require
                  commercial websites and online services to post a privacy
                  policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to
                  require a person or company in the United States (and
                  conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting
                  personally identifiable information from California consumers
                  to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating
                  exactly the information being collected and those individuals
                  with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.

                    Dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days, you and Nemu
                    agree to resolve any Dispute, claim, or controversy
                    (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable
                    relief as provided below) by binding arbitration to be
                    administered by the American Arbitration Association in
                    Delaware (unless the parties both expressly agree on another
                    location) in accordance with the American Arbitration
                    Association's Commercial Arbitration Rules. Each of the
                    parties to this Agreement hereby agrees and consents to such
                    venue and waives any objection thereto. The arbitrability of
                    any such dispute, claim or controversy shall likewise be
                    determined in such arbitration. Such arbitration proceeding
                    shall be conducted in as expedited a manner as is then
                    permitted by the commercial arbitration rules (formal or
                    informal) of the American Arbitration Association. Both the
                    foregoing agreement of the parties to this agreement to
                    arbitrate any and all such disputes, claims and

                    judgments and/or awards rendered through any such
                    arbitration shall be final and binding on the parties hereto
                    and may be specifically enforced by legal proceedings.
                    Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement relating to
                    which state laws govern this Agreement, all issues relating
                    to arbitrability or the enforcement of the agreement to
                    arbitrate contained herein shall be governed by the Federal
                    Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1 et seq.) and the federal
                    common law of arbitration. Each party will be responsible
                    for paying any filing, administrative and arbitrator fees
                    pursuant to and in accordance with AAA rules, and the award
                    rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of
                    arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable costs
                    for expert and other witnesses. Any judgment on the award
                    rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of
                    competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this paragraph shall be
                    deemed as preventing Nemu from seeking injunctive or other
                    equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the
                    actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or
                    violation of our data security, proprietary or Intellectual
                    Property Rights. If an arbitrator or court decides that any
                    part of this agreement to arbitrate is invalid or
                    unenforceable, the other parts of this Section shall still
                    apply. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less,
                    you or Nemu may elect to have the arbitration conducted by
                    telephone or based solely on written submissions, which
                    election shall be binding on you and Nemu subject to the
                    arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing, if
                    the circumstances warrant. In cases where an in-person
                    hearing is held, you and/or Nemu may attend by telephone,
                    unless the arbitrator requires otherwise. You may elect to
                    pursue your claim in small-claims court rather than
                    arbitration if the amount in controversy is less than $2,000
                    and you provide us with written notice of your intention do
                    so within 60 days of the event giving rise to the claim. The
                    arbitration or small-claims court proceeding will be limited
                    solely to your individual dispute or controversy.

                    irreparable harm, you agree that any claim or dispute that
                    has arisen or may arise between you and Nemu must be
                    resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in

                    exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts located within
                    Delaware for the purpose of litigating all such claims or
                    disputes. You further agree that Delaware is the proper
                    forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial
                    court proceedings in the event that the arbitration
                    provision below is found to be unenforceable.
