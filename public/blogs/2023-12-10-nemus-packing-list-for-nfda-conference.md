Team Nemu and I are excited about attending the upcoming NFDA Convention and Expo in Vegas. I am thrilled by the return of in-person events. To help prepare for the conference, we have put together a handy pre-event packing checklist for you:

Plenty of business cards for networking.

Comfortable shoes, preferably slip-ons, for a lot of walking.

A reusable water bottle to keep you hydrated.

Tech essentials: chargers, battery packs, etc.

Personal care items: hand sanitizer, lip balm, and essential medication

A portable steamer for any last-minute touch-ups on your attire.

Spare luggage space for the swag you'll undoubtedly collect.

And don't worry about snacks; join us at the Nemu booth #738 for a snack break.



As a fellow professional serving families during difficult transitions, I understand the invaluable service you provide. I started Nemu based on my personal journey of helping my own family through the inheritance division after my grandmother's passing. My goal is to make this process smoother and more harmonious for all families.



Stop by the Nemu booth #738 to learn how our technology assists families in cataloging, dividing, and managing heirlooms and can expand your business. I'll be there to showcase our platform and discuss collaboration opportunities. If you'd like to chat further, please schedule a time with me!

At our booth, you can:

Can't wait to see you at Nemu booth #738 next week, happy travels!
