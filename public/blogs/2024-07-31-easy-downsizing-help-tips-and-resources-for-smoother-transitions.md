Congratulations on deciding to downsize! Whether you're a senior seeking a more manageable home or an empty nester reorganizing after your kids have left for college, downsizing can happen at any stage of life. The goal is to simplify your life—sounds easy, right? And then you look a little closer…..  Where do you start? What do you keep or discard? What if you let go of something important to someone else? There's certainly plenty to consider. Fortunately, many have navigated this before, and there are tried and true tips and resources to help you avoid feeling overwhelmed. So, take a moment to relax as we review the top things you can do to downsize your anxiety about downsizing!

**Start Early, Start Small**

The thing about downsizing is that you don’t have to do it all at once. In fact, it’s better not to!  Start the downsizing process early to give you ample time to sort through your belongings before things need to be packed to go. Dip your toe into the process with areas that have less sentimental value, such as storage rooms or garages. This approach helps to build momentum and makes the process more manageable.

**Create a Plan, then flex as needed**

Like so many things, having a clear plan definitely jumpstarts successful downsizing. Outline which rooms to tackle first and set realistic timelines. A well-thought-out plan will help keep you organized and focused on your goals. That said, sometimes “creating a plan” can sound overwhelming and keep you from starting. If that’s the case, tell yourself to spend just 10 minutes jotting down a list of the rooms that come to mind. You can always add to or re-order the list later. Everyone’s different, so whichever way works for you is the right way!

**Sort Items into Categories**

Divide your items into categories: This method simplifies decision-making and ensures that each item finds its appropriate place. Here is another area where it’s up to you how best to divide items. Common piles are keep, donate, sell, and discard, using labels or colored bins to keep categories clearly separated. But your categories may be different: Some people sort by family member, or by donation destination (household items to goodwill, old clothes to the local Hospice Care). Pick the categories that make sense for you.

**Involve Family Members**

Involving family members can make downsizing a rewarding experience. Relatives can provide emotional support, lend a hand with physical tasks, and help you decide what to do with sentimental items. Reliving shared experiences together can strengthen memories and make it easier to let go of the physical items left from those experiences. Also, with Nemu, the great thing is that your loved ones don’t have to be there in person. [Nemu's downsizing app](https://www.mynemu.com/downsizing) lets you invite them to join remotely, so they can share their thoughts and relive memories from wherever they are. This way, you can start the process right away without waiting for everyone to gather.

**Use Technology**

Technology can definitely be your friend when it comes to the downsizing process. Use apps to  create digital inventories of your belongings and track donations or sales. [Nemu's heirloom management app](https://www.mynemu.com/downsizing) can help you organize and manage everything in your home, from the large items of furniture to the small collectibles in your garage. Knowing what you have and where it will go helps keep your downsizing process organized and prevents you from endlessly wondering, “What should I do with that…” (whatever it is).

**Sell Valuable Items**

Selling valuable items can provide extra funds and reduce clutter, but you want to be thoughtful about how to go about this as it can also slow down your forward progress. To move multiple items quickly, consider holding a garage sale; to list individual pieces you may be better off using online marketplaces. Consignment stores are another option for selling higher-end items. Not sure if you should save, sell, or donate an item? [Nemu’s appraisal and selling service ](https://www.mynemu.com/)can help you think through the options, and connect you with the right people or online sites where you can take the next step so your downsizing progress doesn’t get bogged down.

**Donate to Charities**

Have a favorite local charity? They might be thrilled you thought of them. Donating usable items to charities helps those in need, clears out your home and keeps usable items out of landfills. Research local charities that accept donations and arrange for pick-ups if available. Donating can be a fulfilling way to give back to the community.

**Repurpose or Recycle**

The last step on the path of finding new homes for things while you downsize is to repurpose or recycle items that cannot be sold or donated. These environmentally friendly approaches minimize waste and find new uses for old belongings. For example, old linen napkins can be turned into a quilt; pieces of old china can be turned into bird feeders, christmas ornaments or jewelry. Not feeling creative in terms of repurposing? Then check with local recycling centers for guidelines on what can be recycled, and let someone else create something new from your items!

**Stay Organized**

Staying organized throughout the downsizing process will help you stick to your plan. Use lists, labels, and containers to keep track of your progress. Looking to take it digital? [Nemu’s inventory management app](https://www.mynemu.com/) lets you catalog everything digitally, organizing items how it makes sense to you. Add notes, descriptions, and voice memos to each item you catalog to not only document where you want things to go, but also how you feel about them. You may choose to let go of these items in the future, but you’ll have the memories forever.  Also, be realistic! Regularly update your plan and adjust timelines as needed if you get distracted or things take longer than expected.
