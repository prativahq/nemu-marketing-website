There’s no doubt about it—our parents and grandparents had some great life lessons that, in hindsight, we all wish we had paid more attention to. Whether it’s about staying organized, passing things down to the next generation, or watching our budget,, the wisdom of older generations can still offer us plenty of practical, down-to-earth advice today, whether we want to believe it or not! Here are some of the smartest ideas my Grandma taught me:

**1. Make a Copy of the Will**

This is one of those things that seems so simple yet people don’t do it anymore -  so it bears repeating (at least that’s how my Grandmother rationalizes it!). Back in her day, she’d say, of course people made sure to have multiple copies of important documents, especially a will. It’s not enough to have just one original stashed away somewhere safe. You need to make at least a few copies and store them in different places—like a safe deposit box, a fireproof box at home, and with a trusted family member or friend. (The bottom of your sock drawer can work too….) Remembering where you put all of them is a different topic entirely!

**PS. While you’re at it - Digitize the Will!**

(To be fair, this one isn’t from my Grandmother as she never loved computers.) But in this day and age it goes without saying that in addition to making physical copies, digitizing important documents such as that will, as well as birth certificates, property deeds, and financial statements is a must-do. Use a secure cloud service to store these files so they’re safe, yet accessible in case of an emergency. 

**2. Document the Stories of the Family Heirlooms**

My grandmother took the time to label many heirlooms with their history—where something came from, who it belonged to, and why it’s significant to our family. When we rolled our eyes  - “we know the stories!” “You’re wasting your time!”, she’d remind us how easily that kind of information can get lost over generations. Documentation not only helps keep family stories alive but also prevents disputes about who gets what. The good news is that the Nemu app helps you create a digital catalog of photos with descriptions, which can be shared with family members and updated as needed.

**3. Create a “When I’m Gone” Folder**

It may sound morbid, but a “When I’m Gone” folder is incredibly practical. (Grandma was really big on this one - every time I’d visit she’d start the conversation by reminding me where hers was, and asking if I’d made one yet!)  This folder should include one of those copies of the will, as well as passwords to important online accounts, instructions for final wishes, and any other information that might be necessary. Think of it as a roadmap for your loved ones to navigate the aftermath of your passing with as little stress as possible. Make sure to tell a few trusted people where to find this folder and update it regularly.

**4. Paying with Cash is Always in Style**

Another piece of advice that feels old fashioned is to pay with cash whenever possible. It was actually my Grandfather who told me that when you pay with cash, you actually feel the money leaving your hands, which makes you think twice about spending it. So while it feels outdated, using cash can help you stay within budget and avoid the temptation to overspend that often comes with using credit cards, or just tapping your phone. Plus, it’s a great way to teach kids about the value of money and budgeting.

**5. A Cluttered House Leads to a Cluttered Brain**

My Grandma always insisted that she couldn’t think straight when the house was a mess.  Her trick to keeping things under control? Frequent Decluttering! Regularly going through each room and deciding what could be donated or thrown away kept the house tidy but also helped us appreciate what you have and pass along items that might be useful to others. It’s a habit that makes your life simpler and can bring joy to someone else who might need those items more than you do.

Incorporating these practical tips from the older generation can help you stay organized, save money, and keep things running smoothly. So, make a copy of the will, sort your socks, keep track of those heirlooms, and never leave the house without some cash. Your future self will thank you!
