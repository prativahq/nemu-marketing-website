Not sure what an estate inventory is, or whether or not it’s something you need to be thinking about?  The textbook way to define it is that an estate inventory is a comprehensive list of all assets owned by an individual. In simpler terms, that means it is one master list of all of somebody’s stuff, all gathered together in one place for easy reference.  Whether you have recently lost a loved one, are going through a divorce, or are planning ahead for yourself or someone else, you may want to start creating this kind of document as part of an overall estate planning process. It gives everyone  a complete picture of what’s being handled so everything goes where it’s supposed to and that there’s no miscommunication. Read on for how these inventories apply in different situations, and how [Nemu’s heirloom management app](http://app.mynemu.com) can help you keep everything organized and accessible.

**First, the When:  When is it time to create an Estate Inventory?**

**1. When a Loved One who has Passed Away**

If you are responsible for the estate of a loved one who has passed away, it’s important the estate inventory include a detailed list of all their assets and liabilities such as personal property, real estate, financial accounts, and any other significant items. You can use  Nemu’s heirloom management app to provide a clear picture of the deceased's estate for proper management and distribution to family members and anyone else with a legal claim to inheritance. 

**2. In Preparation for the Future**

Whether you are downsizing, moving or just trying to get ahead of the game, creating a list of household items with special memories is an important step in preparing for the future. It helps prioritize the work, preserve your legacy and ensures that cherished possessions are passed on according to your wishes. Consider including things like family heirlooms, photos, personal letters, and keepsakes from important moments in your life. Nemu’s heirloom management app helps you capture voice notes and other information about why each item is meaningful and the memories it holds. This way, your loved ones will understand the significance and feel more connected to your life and the stories behind these special items.

**3. To Support Divorce Proceedings**

Creating a comprehensive accounting of belongings during a divorce is critical for ensuring property can be fairly divided. This inventory helps prevent disputes by clearly documenting each item’s existence and value, so both parties have an accurate understanding of shared assets. It should include detailed lists of furniture, appliances, electronics, artwork, jewelry, and other significant personal belongings. High-value items should be appraised, with photos or receipts provided when possible. By thoroughly documenting household items with a helpful tool like  Nemu’s heirloom management app, both parties can work towards an equitable distribution, minimizing conflicts and making the process smoother for everyone.



**Second, the What: Five Types of Assets to Include in any Estate Inventory:** 

**1. Personal Property**

Personal property includes all of the items in the house such as jewelry, furniture, electronics, and other household goods. These items can vary greatly in value and should be listed with as much detail as possible. Including descriptions and approximate values helps ensure accuracy in the reporting process. NEMU’s heirloom management app helps simplify this by allowing users to document all of these important details, all in one place. You can include items  with significant emotional value and even leave voice memos with specific memories about certain things. The more information, the better. 

**2. Real Estate**

Real estate encompasses all property owned by the deceased, including homes, land, and any other buildings. Each property should be listed with its address, current market value, and any outstanding mortgages or liens. Accurate and up-to-date real estate listings are crucial for the estate inventory.

**3. Financial Accounts**

Financial accounts include checking and savings accounts, investment accounts, and retirement accounts. List each account with its current balance and account number. Documentation of these accounts provides a clear financial snapshot of the estate.

**4. Vehicles**

Owned vehicles such as cars, boats, and recreational vehicles, should also be included. Provide details like make, model, year, and estimated value. Do not forget to include any outstanding loans on these vehicles.

**5. Debts and Liabilities**

Debts and liabilities include things like credit card debt, loans, and any other financial obligations. Knowing the liabilities is essential for settling the estate properly. If you are working proactively on an inventory, listing any current accounts is helpful so that any debts can be tracked down more easily later.



**Third, the How: Three Steps for Preparing your Estate Inventory**

**1. Gather Documentation**

Collecting all necessary documentation is the first step in preparing an estate inventory. This includes deeds, account statements, vehicle titles, and any other relevant documents. Having organized documentation makes the process more efficient.

Professional guidance can make a significant difference in the accuracy of the estate inventory. Estate planners, attorneys, and appraisers can provide valuable insights and ensure that nothing is overlooked. You may also want to consider speaking with a therapist. While a lot of the work that needs to be done with estate inventory is related to division of assets and the financial, the whole process can also take an emotional toll on you and your loved ones. It’s important to get the support you need in all regards.
