**Hi everyone**, I'm Varun and today you're gonna learn about the differences between a *library* and a *framework*!\
Lets get started,\
\
Developers often use the terms 'framework' and 'library' interchangeably, but there is a huge **difference** between them.

This difference is based on a term called 'inversion of control': In the case of a library, let's say React, you call the library when you need it. On the other hand, in the case of a framework, let's say Nextjs, your framework controls/calls your code and you're bonded by the rules and regulations of the framework.
